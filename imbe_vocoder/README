If you're building from SVN, you'll need to use this sequence, since
SVN doesn't contain configure or the generated Makefiles.

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check

For increased performance, you may wish to consider compiling with higher
optimization, for example:
  $ ./configure CXXFLAGS="-O3"
or
  $ ./configure CXXFLAGS="-O6"
