This contains the APCO P25 decoder block for GNU Radio and is derived
from the GNU Radio how-to-write-a-block example. This is only part of
the software - you should visit the project website is at
http://www.sedition.org.au/op25 for more information.

This package requires that gnuradio-core is already installed. It also
depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as boost and a suitable
GNU Radio extension to demodulate C4FM. We suggest you use the 4FSK
demodulator from
http://radiorausch.googlepages.com/GnuradioFourLevelFSK.html.

To build the OP25 decoder you need to use the following commands.

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check

Once you've done this you'll need to install

  $ sudo make install
